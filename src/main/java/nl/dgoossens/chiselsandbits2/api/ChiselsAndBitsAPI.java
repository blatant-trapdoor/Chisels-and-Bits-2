/**
 * The Chisels & Bits API is a way for any mod (including C&B2 itself)
 * to interact with C&B tiles and modify them.
 * Much of C&Bs functionality can also be found in the various utility classes
 * in the common.utils package.
 *
 * If you'd like more of C&B to be accessible through the API, like how the API allows adding custom item modes, you can
 * make an issue requesting it. No part of C&B should be hidden from other mods wanting to use it and most enums should
 * be extendable. However, something like VoxelType can't be extended and no PR trying to do so will be merged.

     *
     * A good test to use to figure out if a blockstate should be ignored is as follows:
     *  If you had a block filled completely with logs on different axis, you wouldn't want the block to turn into a full
     *  log block with a single axis. So axis should be a property of a chiseled bit.
     *
     *  If you had a block filled with leaves with varying distance values, you would want the block to turn into a full
     *  block regardless of the distance values of the parts of the block. So DISTANCE_1_7 should be ignored.
     *
     *  Furthermore, different blockstates values also cause the face to be rendered, so only blockstates that can alter
     *  the rotation or rendering of the block should go un-ignored ideally.
